What_are_Targets_in_Linux_?_🐧

> In simpler terms, think of targets in Linux like different modes your computer can be in. 
> Each mode is designed for different tasks.
> For example, one mode might focus on just basic functions, while another might be all about running programs with a fancy graphical interface. 
> So, targets help your computer know what it should be doing at any given time.

> To check our system's current default target we use this command 📝:

## systemctl get-default ##

01 - multi-user.target -> The multiuser target in Linux is a Command Line Interface and it's like a mode where multiple people can use the computer at the same time.
It's perfect for situations where several users need to log in and do their own stuff on the computer simultaneously.
So, when your system is in the multiuser target, it's ready for several users to work on it together.

02 - graphical.target -> The multiuser target in Linux is a Graphical User Interface and it's like a mode where multiple people can use the computer at the same time. 
It's perfect for situations where several users need to log in and do their own stuff on the computer simultaneously. 
So, when your system is in the multiuser target, it's ready for several users to work on it together.

03 - emergency.target -> The emergency target in Linux is like a special mode for fixing serious problems when your system isn't working properly.
It's a simplified environment that provides essential tools for troubleshooting and repairing issues that might prevent your computer from starting normally.
So, when your system is in the emergency target, it's focused on helping you fix problems and get your computer back up and running smoothly.

04 - rescue.target -> It's similar to the emergency target but provides more advanced tools for diagnosing and repairing problems.
The rescue target is typically used when your system is so messed up that it can't even start properly.
It gives you access to a basic environment where you can fix problems with your system's configuration, recover files, or repair disk issues.
So, when your system is in the rescue target, it's focused on helping you rescue your system from major troubles.

> To change our default target we use the command :

> Let's assume that our current default target is a multi-user.target but we want to change it into a graphical target ->

## sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target ##

> To change current target without messing with our default target we use the command :

> Let's assume that our current default target is a multi-user.target but we want to switch into a graphical target without changing anything by default ->

## sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target ##
